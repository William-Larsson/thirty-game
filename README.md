## Thirty
The dice game Thirty implented in an Android application. 
This was created as the first assignment on the course *Development of mobile applications* at Ume√• Univeristy.

## What I learned
* The basics of Android development in Java. 
* Using recursive algorithms to solve subset sum calculations.
* Using Test Driven Development with JUnit to build the logic.
* Practicing the MVC design pattern.

## About the game
Thirty is a dice game not quite unlike Yatzy where you roll six dice in turns. After the initial roll the player can decide to re-roll the dice up to two times. After each roll, the player can choose which dice they want to keep, and which ones to re-roll. After a maximum of two re-rolls per turn, the score is calculated for the dice. A game then consists of 10 turns just like this. The player will therefore make at most of 30 dice rolls in total, hence the name of the game.
